## Description

Live [here](https://alessandrogiacomini.github.io/photoWebsite/)

The website presents a quickly wonderfull view of the power of photography which has always been part of my life. A backflip into 2015! From ice caves to twin tornadoes; from the menacing form of a shark parting a sea of fish to one of the most incredible volcanic eruptions. The Best of 2015 with the Top 10 Nature photos of the year..
